# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Contains code that I used for solving various programming problems on Codechef, InterviewBit and HackerRank. <br/> <br/> 
The problems are primarily based on the following topics : <br/>
- Arrays
- Math
- Binary Search
- Strings
- Bit Manipulation
- Two Pointers
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Backtracking
- Hashing
- Heaps and Maps
- Trees
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms
